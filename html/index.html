          <p> This site is still evolving. Some viewers might notice that the background image contains Python Code. The code is actually a small script I wrote to determine the primality of numbers or return a series or prime numbers. It will also return a series or Fibonacci numbers, which consequently, are the numbers behind the green code that fill the background.</p>

          <p>While I do some websites in C# / asp.net, this server is running a full LAMP stack, so I do not have any asp.net sites here... yet. Hopefully I will have the .net framework, through Mono, up and running soon. </p>

          <p>Mono is up and running.  I am in the process of getting a functioning MCV website running, but it is proving to be quite a dificult process.  I did manage to get a <a href="http://developme.us:8080">Generic sample site</a> up as a place holder. </p>

          <p>Had some issues with mono not staying up, so i wrote a little python script to keep it up.  Mono has been up for 2 days now, so it should be stable.

          <p>Although I was able to get Mono/.Net working for C# applications, it proved to be rather lacking for MVC website modeling.  I am still keeping Mono around for the C# programs that i build, but I decided to stop wasting my time with .Net MVC and instead went to ruby on rails (You know.... since it was originally developed for Linux). I have started building a rails application that you can view <a href="http://developme.us/blog">here.</a> <strong>(I did have some trouble with Rails' stability on Ubuntu, so I switched back to CentOS.  Hopefully, it stays up this time.) </strong> Hell, I may even start posting some pure ruby apps to GitHub. </p>
